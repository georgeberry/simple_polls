# simple_polls

Median polling estimate with trendline adjustment

## how do I use this?

In your shell:

```
python3 get_polls.py

python3 make_data.py
```

You should now have `polls.csv` which contains the poll data.

Then, open up RStudio and work through `analysis.R`. I've included `prediction.R` in case you want to use this simplest-possible-model to predict election outcomes.
